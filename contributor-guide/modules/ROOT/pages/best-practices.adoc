This section contains guidance on how to reduce development time from concept through to publishing of a new library.

== Common Dependencies

Some libraries are published with the intended primary audience, or in some cases the sole audience, being developers of other libraries. These libraries are published to make some of the time consuming and awkward processes of Boost-compliance easier. It is good practice for a new library developer to read the introductions to each of these libraries, and ascertain if they might be of value to the library they are developing. The libraries in the following table are listed in the order of the number of other libraries that have included them as a primary dependency. The top eight listed below are a primary dependency of 50 or more other libraries.
