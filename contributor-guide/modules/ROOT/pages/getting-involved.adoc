= Getting Involved

@anarthal: content suggestion: How can you contribute to Boost?

* What's the mailing list, what prupose does it serve and how do I subscribe
* How to report issues or possible improvements (there's a section on this in the user guide, keep short and provide a link)
* Contributing to an existing library with fixes and improvements
* Becoming the maintainer of an existing library: how can you do it, what does it involve, and list of libraries that need a maintainer
* Getting involved in the review process (there are sections about this in the formal review document, link to them)
* Becoming a library author (that's what the next section is about, link to it)
