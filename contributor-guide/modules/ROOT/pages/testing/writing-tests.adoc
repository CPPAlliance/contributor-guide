= Writing tests

@anarthal: content suggestion:

* Using a testing framework vs. executables
* The framework we can use: Boost.Test and lightweight test. What we can't use and why (gtest, catch2)
* Running tests from b2 and cmake
* Running examples as tests
* Running docs snippets as tests
* What if I have integration tests?
* Testing cmake workflows
