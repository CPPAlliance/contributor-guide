:navtitle: TortoiseGit Library Maintenance

This page provides illustrations for using the https://tortoisegit.org/about/[TortoiseGit] extension to Windows Explorer to perform the same Git operations shown using the command line client in xref:modular-boost/library-maintenance.adoc[Getting Started with Modular Boost Library Maintenance].

The TortoiseGit dialog boxes shown on this page are accesses via the right-click drop-down menu for a directory containing a git repository working copy. The exact appearance of the drop-down menu will vary according to the Windows version and other installed extensions. Here is what it looks like on the Windows 7 machine used to generate the screen shots.

== Cloning the Boost Super-project

After selecting *Git Clone...* from the drop-down menu, the Clone dialog box pops-up. After changing the *Directory* from the default *boost* to *modular-boost* and checking the *Recursive* check-box, it looks like this:

Red ellipses indicate changes from defaults.

Click *OK* to start the operation. A *Git Command Progress* box appears, and reports progress during the operation. Once the operation completes, the progress box looks like this:

Note the scroll bar on the left. Use it to view the entire progress from beginning to end.
