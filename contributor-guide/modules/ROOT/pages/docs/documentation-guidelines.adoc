:navtitle: Documentation Guidelines

It is not a requirement for a Boost library for the documentation to adhere to the following structure. However, it is listed here as a guide, if needed.

The following structure for Boost library documentation should work for most libraries. Take each template, where one exists, in the order listed below, and fill in the details for your library.

The format for documentation on the new website is https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDocs].

Where you see `<LibraryName>` in the templates, replace with the name of your library.
