= Boost Style Guide

This document outlines the style guidelines for the site-docs. Adhering to these
guidelines will help ensure consistency and cohesion across all pages of the website.

== Color Guidelines
[disc]
* Boost Mustard

** only use for one or two key top level headings.
** never on inactive UI controls
** OK to use for hover state
** never use large areas of this color in illustrations
** never used as an endpoint of a color blend

== Wording Guidelines
[disc]
* The word "Boost" should occur no more than once per page, not counting logo, but logo should not be visible in two places.
** user generated content excluded

* The word "C++" should occur no more than once on a page
** user-generated content excluded

We want to minimize the number of times we use the word "Boost" on a page. Since the logo in the header has the word "Boost" in it, sometimes we will have no choice but to use the word at least twice on a page. But we should try to minimize the repetitions.

== URL Display 
[disc]
* Per-library links (e.g. GitHub or docs) should use a schemeless URL:

image::url-style-guide-image.png[]

== Image Display
[disc]
* User avatars should never be displayed squared, always with rounded corners
