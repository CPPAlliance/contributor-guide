= Header Organization and Compiled Binaries
:navtitle: Header Organization and Compiled Binaries

This section covers the basics of the organization of Boost libraries in the folder structure, a list of libraries requiring compilation into binaries, or optionally using compilation, and the tools which you might use to compile the headers.

== Header Organization

The organization of Boost library headers isn't entirely uniform, but most libraries follow a few patterns:

[disc]
* Some older libraries and most very small libraries place all public headers directly into Boost.

* Most libraries' public headers live in a subdirectory of *boost*, named after the library.
For example, you'll find the Python library's
`def.hpp` header in `boost/python/def.hpp`.

* Some libraries have an “aggregate header” in boost that includes all of the library's other headers.
For example,
boost:python[]'s aggregate header is `boost/python.hpp`.

* Most libraries place private headers in a subdirectory called
*detail*, or *aux*.
Don't expect to find anything you can use in these directories.

It's important to note the following:

. The path to the *boost root directory* (often
*/usr/local/boost_1_82_0*) is sometimes referred to as `$BOOST_ROOT`
in documentation and mailing lists.

. To compile anything in Boost, you need a directory containing the
*boost* subdirectory in your `#include` path.

. Since all of Boost's header files have the `.hpp` extension, and live in the *boost* subdirectory of the boost root, your Boost `#include`
directives will look like: `#include <boost/whatever.hpp>` or `#include "boost/whatever.hpp"`, depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket includes.

. Don't be distracted by the *doc* subdirectory; it only contains a subset of the Boost documentation.
Start with `libs/index.html` if you're looking for the whole enchilada.

== Required Compiled Binaries

Most Boost libraries are *header-only*: they consist _entirely of header files_ containing templates and inline functions, and require no separately-compiled library binaries or special treatment when linking.

The only Boost libraries that _must_ be built separately are:

[disc]
* boost:atomic[]

* boost:chrono[]

* boost:container[]

* boost:context[]

* boost:contract[]

* boost:coroutine[]

* boost:date_time[]

* boost:fiber[]

* boost:filesystem[]

* boost:graph_parallel[]

* boost:iostreams[]

* boost:json[]

* boost:locale[]

* boost:log[]

* boost:mpi[]

* boost:nowide[]

* boost:program_options[]

* boost:python[]

* boost:regex[]

* boost:serialization[]

* boost:stacktrace[]

* boost:thread[]

* boost:timer[]

* boost:type_erasure[]

* boost:url[]

* boost:wave[]

== Optional Compiled Binaries

A few libraries have optional separately-compiled binaries:

* boost:exception[] provides non-intrusive implementation of exception_ptr for 32-bit `_MSC_VER==1310`
and `_MSC_VER==1400` which requires a separately-compiled binary.
This is enabled by `#define BOOST_ENABLE_NON_INTRUSIVE_EXCEPTION_PTR`.

* boost:graph[] also has a binary component that is only needed if you intend to parse GraphViz files.

* boost:math[] has binary components for the TR1 and C99 cmath functions.

* boost:random[] has a binary component which is only needed if you're using `random_device`.

* boost:system[] is header-only since Boost 1.69. A stub library is still built for compatibility, but linking to it is no longer necessary.

* boost:test[] can be used in “header-only” or “separately compiled” mode, although *separate compilation is recommended for serious use*.

== Identify Your Toolset

In order to build binaries from source, find the toolset corresponding to your compiler in the following table (an up-to-date list is also available in https://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/reference/tools.html[Builtin tools]).

Note::
If you previously chose a toolset for the purposes of building b2, you should assume it won't work and instead choose newly from the table below.

[#toolset]
[width="100%",cols="12%,22%,66%",options="header",stripes=even]
|===
|Toolset Name |Vendor |Notes
|`acc` |Hewlett Packard |Only very recent versions are known to work
well with Boost

|`borland` |Borland |

|`como` |Comeau Computing |Using this toolset may require configuring another toolset to act as its backend.

|`darwin` |Apple Computer |Apple's version of the GCC toolchain with support for Darwin and MacOS X features such as frameworks.

|`gcc` |The Gnu Project |Includes support for Cygwin and MinGW compilers.

|`hp_cxx` |Hewlett Packard |Targeted at the Tru64 operating system.

|`intel` |Intel |

|`msvc` |Microsoft |

|`sun` |Oracle | Only very recent versions are known to work well with
Boost. Note that the Oracle/Sun compiler has a large number of options
which effect binary compatibility. It is vital that the libraries are
built with the same options that your application will use. In particular
be aware that the default standard library may not work well with Boost,
unless you are building for Cpp11.

The particular compiler options you need can be injected with the b2 command line options `cxxflags=` and `linkflags=`. For example to build with the Apache standard library in Cpp03 mode use:

`b2 cxxflags=-library=stdcxx4 linkflags=-library=stdcxx4`.

|`vacpp` |IBM |The VisualAge C++ compiler.
|===

If you have multiple versions of a particular compiler installed, you can append the version number to the toolset name, preceded by a hyphen, e.g. `intel-9.0`  or `borland-5.4.3`.

On Windows, append a version number even if you only have one version installed (unless you are using the msvc or gcc toolsets, which have special version detection code) or auto-linking will fail.
