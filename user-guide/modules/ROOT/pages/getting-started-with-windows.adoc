= Getting Started with Windows

This section explains how to get your first Boost app running on Windows. The entire set of libraries is installed, which gives you the chance to explore the features and functionality available.

== Prerequisites

[circle]
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition) is used as the IDE and C++ compiler in the examples (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). If you are using a different system, you will need to investigate and adjust the steps accordingly.

* The Boost library is currently just under 200 MB. Make sure you have ample disk space to download and extract the full library. Downloading and installing specific libraries is explained in the "Getting Started with Windows and a Package Manager".

== Download and Extract the Full Boost Library Package

To install the full set of Boost libraries on Windows:

. Navigate to https://www.boost.org/users/download/.

. Under *Current Release/Downloads*, click the Windows .zip option.

. After the download has completed (in your *Downloads* folder), right-click on the zip file and extract it to a folder. It does not matter where you extract it to, but consider extracting it to your *Documents* folder, just so that it is easy to locate from a command window.

NOTE: Extracting the zip takes some time. If you have a .7z extractor application, you can download the .7z version. This uses less space, and extracts quicker, than the .zip alternative. Refer to https://7-zip.org/.

== Bootstrap the Boost Build App

. Open up a command line terminal, and navigate to the folder containing the *bootstrap.bat* file. If you used the folder location specified above, this would mean entering `cd documents\boost-libraries`.

. The Boost libraries are built using a custom build app called *b2.exe*. This app itself is built by running `.\bootstrap.bat` in your command window. 

NOTE:: You do not need read the build documentation to complete this guide, however, for more information, refer to the https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/tools/build/doc/html/index.html[B2 User Manual].

== Build and Install the Boost Libraries

Building and installing Boost libraries also takes some time.

. Decide where you are going to install the libraries to, most locations are OK, something like *Documents/Boost-libraries* is fine. If your location has a space in the name, you will need to surround the path in quotes in the commands that follow.

. In the Command Window folder now containing the *b2.exe* app, run the app by entering `.\b2.exe`. This builds the libraries, but does not yet install them. Refer to <<Troubleshooting the Build and Install Process>>, if you get any errors.

. Now enter `.\b2.exe --prefix=<YOUR-INSTALL-FOLDER> -d0 install`. This installs the libraries to your selected folder. The option `-d0` suppresses most of the command line warnings and messages. 

NOTE:: We break the build and install into separate steps, in order to get better diagnostics when building the libraries, and to suppress too many messages when installing the libraries. The single command `.\b2.exe --prefix=<YOUR-INSTALL-FOLDER> -d0 install` will both build and install, but suppresses too many messages during the build process. If something goes wrong, it will probably be during the build process, and we want to know about it.

. The build process creates all variants of each library. For example, there may be _Release_ and _Debug_ variants, or possibly _Multithreaded_ and _Static_ runtime variants. Also, libraries that are _header-only_ (in other words, do not require being built) are copied to your installation folder. Quickly examine your installation folder to see that it is well populated, or enter `.\b2.exe --show libraries` in your command window.

=== Troubleshooting the Build and Install Process

* If you get an error during the build process such as the following, you probably do not have an up to date and full installation of C++ on your machine. Go back to <<Prerequisites>> and install or update your version of Visual Studio.

== Create and Run a "Hello World" App

. Open Visual Studio and select *Create a new project*. Choose *Console App* from the range of project templates.

. Change the names in the *Configure your new project* dialog, or leave the defaults, and click *Create*.

. Replace all the boilerplate content of the .cpp file with the following, noting the inclusion of the compiled header from Boost: *lambda.hpp*:

+
[source,C++]
----
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::lambda;
    typedef std::istream_iterator<int> in;

    std::for_each(
        in(std::cin), in(), std::cout << (_1 * 3) << " ");
}
----

. Right-click on the name of the project in the *Solution Explorer* pane, and select *Properties*.

. Under *C/C++* select *General*, then click on *Additional Include Directories*. Add the path to your Boost *include* folder, that will have been built in the previous section.

. Next, still in the project properties, select *Linker*, then *General*, and locate the *Additional Library Directories*. Add the path to the Boost *lib* folder.

image::additional-library-directories.png[]

. Click *OK* to accept your input, and then in the *Debug* menu, select *Start Without Debugging*, or press the F5 key.

. A command window should open up, so enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, and then *Enter*.

. You should get a line of numbers, your originals multiplied by 3.

== Create and Run a GitHub Example App

In this section, we will locate an example from a folder on GitHub, and then build and run a project based on the example.

For most Boost libraries, there is an *example* subfolder containing a range of runnable examples. For this guide, we will locate an example that reads a JSON file, and pretty-prints the contents.

. Create a new Visual Studio C++ Console App. Name it JsonPrint.

. Update both the additional include directories, and additional library directories, as you did for the previous section.

. Copy all the code from https://github.com/boostorg/json/blob/develop/example/pretty.cpp, and use it to replace all the default content of the project's cpp file.

. Add to your project a file called file.hpp, then copy all the content from https://github.com/boostorg/json/blob/develop/example/file.hpp into that file.

. Search your computer for any JSON file, unless you have one you would like to use already. Record the full path to that file.

. In Visual Studio, locate and select *Build Solution*. 

. In a Command Window, navigate to where the .exe file for the solution has been built. This will often be `C:\Users\YOUR NAME\source\repos\JsonPrint\x64\Debug`.

. In the command window, type `JsonPrint PATH`, where PATH is the full path to your JSON file, including the filename. You should get neatly formatted output:

=== Troubleshooting Create and Run a GitHub Example App

[circle]
* If your JSON included symbols such as the umlaut, these will not be rendered correctly unless you change the format of your command window to UTF-8. By default, a command window supports a code page numbered 437. To change the code page to UTF-8, type `chcp 65001`.

* If you get compile errors such as `cannot open file 'libboost_json-vc143-mt-gd-x64-1_81.lib'` you have probably not entered the *Additional Library Directories* correctly.


== Summary

Although the samples you have now built and run are quite simple, if you have got this far successfully, it means your build and installation and project linking are all working correctly. Great job!

== Next Steps

You might like to scan the examples folders of some of the other libraries that you are interested in, and create and run projects to get them running.

Once you are more experienced with Boost, you might like to build and install only those libraries you require. This process is best managed by a _Package Manager_.
