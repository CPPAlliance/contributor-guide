:navtitle: Reporting Issues

If you come across a bug, or other issue, with one of the libraries, go through the following process to report it:

. If you know where to look in the source code, make sure the bug isn't already fixed in the latest sources, refer to the https://github.com/boostorg[Boost.org repositories].

. https://github.com/boostorg/boost/issues[Search the issues] on GitHub to make sure we don't already know about the bug. If we do, you can certainly add further information to an existing bug ticket.

. If the bug has not been fixed already, and there is no relevant issue, then https://github.com/boostorg/boost/issues/new[Create a New Issue], either in the repository of the particular library of interest, or in the boost super-project.

If possible,

[disc]
* Describe the problem carefully, including steps required to reproduce it by a library maintainers.

* Attach a _minimal_ and _complete_ program that reproduces the problem. Aside from helping the library maintainer fix the problem, you may find the bug in your own code, which can avoid a costly delay waiting for a response.
