= What's inside?

@anarthal: TBC: content. Talk about the different useful stuff we have.

Suggestions:

* Talk about STL equivalents that are superior in performance
* Talk about networking
* Talk about combining libs for certain use cases (task-based/scenario-based approach), e.g. gaming, server application, embedded, etc.
* Talk abour projects that are already using Boost (bitcoint-core, mysql server, MongoDB server, React Native)
