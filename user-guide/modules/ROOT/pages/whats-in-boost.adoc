= What's in Boost?

@anarthal: TBC: content. Talk about the different useful stuff we have, for example:

* Containers, algorithms, iterators
* Generic & template meta
* Math & numerics
* Concurrent
* Image processing
* Networking
* Testing

Suggestions: talk about combining libs for certain use cases (task-based/scenario-based approach), e.g. gaming, server application, embedded, etc.
