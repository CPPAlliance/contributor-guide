= Use Boost with Linux and a Package Manager

Yes, you can use vcpkg on Linux. To install vcpkg on a Linux system, follow these steps:

Open a terminal.

Install the necessary packages for building vcpkg by running the following command (for Ubuntu or Debian-based systems):

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential tar curl zip unzip git
For other Linux distributions, install the equivalent packages using the appropriate package manager, such as yum, dnf, or pacman.

Clone the vcpkg repository from GitHub by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
This command will create a new directory named "vcpkg" in your current directory and clone the repository into it.

Change to the "vcpkg" directory using the "cd" command:
bash
Copy code
cd vcpkg
Run the bootstrap script to build the vcpkg executable:
bash
Copy code
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
This script will download and build the necessary components for vcpkg. It might take a few minutes to complete.

(Optional) Add the vcpkg executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This step makes it easier to run vcpkg from any directory. Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
To make this change permanent, add the above export command to your shell's configuration file, such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile for the Bash shell.

Now, vcpkg is installed on your Linux system, and you can start using it to manage your C++ project dependencies. To install a package, you can run a command like:

bash
Copy code
./vcpkg install <package-name>
Replace <package-name> with the name of the package you want to install.
