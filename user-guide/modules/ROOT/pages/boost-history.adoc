= History of the Boost C++ Library
:navtitle: History of Boost

This topic aims to provide an overview of the origins, growth, and impact of Boost on the programming community.

== Introduction

Boost is a highly influential and widely used collection of libraries, designed to extend and complement the functionality provided by the pass:[C++] Standard Library. Since its original https://www.boost.org/users/proposal.pdf[Proposal] in 1998, Boost has played a significant role in shaping the evolution of the pass:[C++] language and its ecosystem.

== Origins

The story of Boost began, when Robert Klarer, Beman Dawes, and Dave Abrahams convened the first Boost mailing list to facilitate discussions on the creation of high-quality, peer-reviewed libraries for the pass:[C++] programming language. At the time, the pass:[C++] Standard Library was limited in its functionality, and many developers felt the need for additional libraries to support the growing demands of software development. The name "Boost" was chosen to represent the goal of boosting the pass:[C++] language and its library ecosystem to new heights.

== Early Development

The first few libraries that formed the basis of Boost were created by a group of dedicated and talented pass:[C++] programmers. Early libraries included the boost:smart_ptr[] library, which provided support for reference counting and garbage collection, and the boost:regex[] library, which added regular expression support to the language. The first official release was in 2000, and contained 24 libraries.

Boost quickly gained traction and attracted more contributors who shared a common vision of improving the pass:[C++] language through high-quality, portable, and reusable code.

== Peer Review Process

One of the defining characteristics of Boost is its strict peer review process. Before a library is accepted into Boost, it must undergo a thorough review by other experienced pass:[C++] developers. This process ensures that only high-quality libraries, adhering to the best programming practices, are included in the collection. The peer review process not only maintains the quality of Boost but also fosters a sense of community and encourages collaboration among its contributors.

== Influence on the pass:[C++] Language and Community

Boost has had a profound impact on the pass:[C++] language and its community. Many of the libraries and concepts introduced by Boost have been adopted into the pass:[C++] Standard Library, including smart pointers, regular expressions, and the boost:lambda[] function syntax. Boost has also been a fertile ground for experimenting with new ideas and techniques, which have later made their way into the pass:[C++] language itself, such as boost:type_traits[] and boost:mpl[].

== A Timeline of Boost Exclusivity

While many Boost libraries have been incorporated into the C++ Standard Library, most others remain exclusive to Boost but are highly regarded for their capabilities and performance. Some of these noteworthy libraries include:

[square]
* boost:graph[] : An extensive library for graph data structures and algorithms, enabling developers to work with graphs and network structures, while providing efficient implementations of popular graph algorithms like Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, and more. Appeared in Boost in *August 2000*.

* boost:spirit[] : A powerful and flexible parser and generator framework, which uses expression templates and template metaprogramming to create parsers at compile-time. This results in efficient and type-safe parsing code. Added to Boost *February 2003*, though has gone through multiple updates.

* boost:asio[] : A cross-platform library for network and low-level I/O programming, offering a consistent asynchronous model that allows developers to write efficient and highly-scalable applications. Added to Boost *April 2008*.

* boost:geometry[] : A library providing a collection of algorithms and data structures for working with geometrical objects, such as points, lines, polygons, and more. It also supports spatial indexing, coordinate system transformations, and various distance calculations. Added to Boost *July 2011*.

* boost:compute[]: A library for parallel and high-performance computing on GPUs and other OpenCL devices, offering a high-level, easy-to-use interface for working with OpenCL. Added to Boost *November 2014*.

* boost:hana[] : A modern metaprogramming library for pass:[C++] that employs cutting-edge pass:[C++] features to facilitate powerful and expressive metaprogramming techniques, such as heterogeneous containers, compile-time algorithms, and type introspection. Added to Boost *May 2016*.

* boost:json[] : A JSON library for encoding, decoding, and manipulating JSON data. Added to Boost in *January 2021*.

These libraries, among others, showcase the value and versatility of Boost in providing advanced functionality beyond the scope of the pass:[C++] standard library.

== Current Status

Boost has come a long way since its inception in the late 1990s, to a widely used and influential https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/[collection of over 180 libraries]. Boost has played a crucial role in shaping the pass:[C++] language and its ecosystem. As the pass:[C++] language continues to evolve, Boost will undoubtedly remain an essential and innovative part of its story.
