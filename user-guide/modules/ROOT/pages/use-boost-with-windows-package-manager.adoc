= Use Boost with Windows and a Package Manager
:navtitle: Boost Windows Package Manager

This section describes how to manage Boost libraries using the *vcpkg* package manager. It is an open source and free app.

== Advantages of using vcpkg

A package manager like vcpkg can add value by streamlining the process of managing dependencies in a software project. It can be particularly helpful in C++ projects, which often have complex dependency chains. Some of the key benefits of using vcpkg include:

* Simplified dependency management: vcpkg automates the process of downloading, building, and installing libraries, saving developers time and effort.

* Consistent environment: vcpkg ensures that all developers on a team use the same library versions, helping to avoid inconsistencies and bugs that can arise from using different library versions in different environments.

* Cross-platform support: vcpkg supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easier to develop cross-platform projects.

* Binary caching: vcpkg caches compiled binaries, speeding up subsequent builds and installations of the same libraries across different projects.

* Version control: vcpkg allows developers to specify the exact version of a library they want to use, ensuring that updates to libraries do not introduce breaking changes to their projects.

* Library discovery: vcpkg has a large catalog of available libraries, making it easy for developers to discover and use new libraries in their projects.

* Integration with build systems: vcpkg integrates with popular build systems like CMake, simplifying the process of adding dependencies to a project.

* Regular updates and maintenance: vcpkg is actively maintained and updated by Microsoft, ensuring that the package manager and its libraries stay current and compatible with the latest development tools and practices.

By providing these benefits, a package manager like vcpkg helps developers to focus on writing code and building features, rather than spending time on managing dependencies manually.

== Install the Package Manager

To install vcpkg on a Windows PC, follow these steps:

. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrative privileges. You can do this by searching for *cmd* or *PowerShell* in the Start menu, right-clicking on the relevant result, and choosing *Run as administrator*.

. Clone the vcpkg repository from GitHub by running the following command: `it clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`. This command will create a new directory named *vcpkg* in your current directory and clone the repository into it. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it.

. Change to the *vcpkg* directory using the `cd` command: `cd vcpkg`.

. Run the bootstrap script to build the vcpkg executable: `.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`. This script will download and build the necessary components for vcpkg. It might take a few minutes to complete.

. (Optional) Add the vcpkg executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This step makes it easier to run vcpkg from any directory. Run the following command: `.\vcpkg integrate install`. After running this command, you'll see a message with instructions on how to add vcpkg to your user-wide environment. Follow the instructions to ensure you can use vcpkg from any directory.

== Using the Package Manager

Now, vcpkg is installed on your Windows PC, and you can start using it to manage your C++ project dependencies. 

. To install a package, you can run a command like: `.\vcpkg install <package-name>`, replacing <package-name> with the name of the package you want to install.

. To verify access to Boost libraries, enter `vcpkg search boost`. You should see a full list of the Boost libraries you have installed.
