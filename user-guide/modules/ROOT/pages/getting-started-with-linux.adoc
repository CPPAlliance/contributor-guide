:navtitle: Getting Started Linux

To install the Boost libraries on a Linux system, you can either use the package manager provided by your distribution or compile and install Boost from the source code. Here's a step-by-step guide for installing from source.

If you are used to working with a package manager, refer to xref:use-boost-with-linux-package-manager.adoc[Use Boost with Linux and a Package Manager].

== Installing from Source

. Open a terminal window. 

. Install the necessary build tools and libraries. For Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions, use the following commands: 

+
[source]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3 libbz2-dev libz-dev libicu-dev
----
+
For Fedora systems, use the following commands:
+
[source]
----
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ python3 bzip2-devel zlib-devel libicu-devel
----
+
For CentOS systems, use the following commands:
+
[source]
----
sudo yum update
sudo yum install gcc-c++ python3 bzip2-devel zlib-devel libicu-devel
----
+
For Arch-based systems (Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc.), use the following commands:
+
[source]
----
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S base-devel python3 bzip2 zlib icu
----


. Download the latest Boost source code from the official website (https://www.boost.org/users/download/), or use `wget` to download it directly: 

+
[source]
----
wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.82.0/source/boost_1_82_0.tar.bz2
----

+
*Replace the URL and version number (1.82.0) with the latest version available.*

. Extract the downloaded archive:
+
[source]
----
tar xvfj boost_1_82_0.tar.bz2
----

. Change to the extracted directory:

+
[source]
----
cd boost_1_82_0
----

. Run the bootstrap script to prepare for building Boost:

+
[source]
----
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local
----
+
The --prefix option specifies the installation directory. You can change this to your preferred location.

. Build and install Boost: `sudo ./b2 install`. This command builds and installs the Boost libraries to the specified prefix directory.

. (Optional) To use the installed Boost libraries, you may need to update your environment variables:
+
For LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
+
[source]
----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
----
+
For CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:
+
[source]
----
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
----
+
Replace `/usr/local` with the prefix directory you specified during the installation, if different.
+
You can add these `export` commands to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file to make the changes permanent.

After completing either method, you should have the Boost libraries installed on your Linux system.

== Your First App

To keep things simple, letâ€™s start by using a header-only library. The following program reads a sequence of integers from standard input, uses Boost.Lambda to multiply each number by three, and writes them to standard output:

. Copy the following program into a file called *example.cpp*.
+
[source,C++]
----
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::lambda;
    typedef std::istream_iterator<int> in;

    std::for_each(
        in(std::cin), in(), std::cout << (_1 * 3) << " ");
}
----

. Now, in the directory where you saved *example.cpp*, issue the following command (replacing _NN_ with the Boost version number you are using):

+
[source]
----
c++ -I path/to/boost_1_82_0 example.cpp -o example
----

. To test the result, type:
+
[source]
----
echo 1 2 3 | ./example
----

. Did you get the expected result?

== Create and Run a GitHub Example App

In this section, we will locate an example from a folder on GitHub, and then build and run a project based on the example.

For most Boost libraries, there is an *example* subfolder containing a range of runnable examples. For this guide, we will locate an example that reads a JSON file, and pretty-prints the contents.

. Copy all the code from https://github.com/boostorg/json/blob/develop/example/pretty.cpp, and use it to replace all the default content of the project's cpp file.

. Add to your project a file called *file.hpp*, then copy all the content from https://github.com/boostorg/json/blob/develop/example/file.hpp into that file.

. Search your computer for any JSON file, unless you have one you would like to use already. Record the full path to that file.
