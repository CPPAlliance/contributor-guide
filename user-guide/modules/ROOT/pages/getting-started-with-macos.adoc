= Getting Started with macOS

To install and build Boost libraries on macOS, you can either use CMake, or install and use a package manager such as Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software packages. 

== Install Boost using CMake

If you do not wish to use an package manager, installing Boost libraries on macOS using CMake involves several steps. Here's an outline of the process:

. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the Boost library files.

. Run the bootstrap.sh script to generate the build system files for your platform. For example, to build Boost with clang on macOS, run:

[source,txt]
----
./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=clang
----

. After the bootstrap process completes, run the following command to build and install the Boost libraries: .`/b2 install`.

. Once the Boost libraries are installed, you can use CMake to configure your project to use them. Here's an example CMakeLists.txt file that uses Boost:

[source, cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(MyProject)

find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)

add_executable(MyProject main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(MyProject Boost::system)
----

. This CMakeLists.txt file assumes that your main.cpp file uses the Boost system library. You may need to modify it to use other Boost libraries depending on your project's requirements.

. Run CMake to generate the build system files for your project: `cmake .`

. After the CMake configuration process completes, you can build your project using your preferred build system (e.g. make, ninja, etc.): `make`.

== Install Boost using Homebrew

Here's a step-by-step guide to installing the Boost libraries using Homebrew.

== Prerequisites

Homebrew has a few prerequisites, one of which is the Xcode Command Line Tools. The Xcode Command Line Tools include essential developer tools, like compilers and build utilities, that Homebrew needs to function properly.

When you install Homebrew using the installation script, it will automatically check for the presence of the Xcode Command Line Tools. If they are not already installed, the script will prompt you to install them.

However, if you want to manually install the Xcode Command Line Tools before installing Homebrew, you can follow these steps:

. Open Terminal.

. Run the following command: `xcode-select --install`. A pop-up window will appear, prompting you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click *Install* to start the installation process.

Once the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, you can proceed with installing Homebrew.

It's important to note that the full Xcode application is not required to use Homebrew, but it can be beneficial for developers who need additional development tools or want to create macOS and iOS applications. You can download and install the full Xcode application from the Mac App Store if you need it.

== Install Homebrew

You can skip step 1 if you have already installed Homebrew.

. Open Terminal and run the following command: 

+
[source]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
----
+
This command will download and execute the Homebrew installation script. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

. Update Homebrew. Before installing the Boost libraries, it's a good idea to update Homebrew to ensure you have the latest package information. Run the following command: `brew update`.

== Install Boost

. Now you can install the Boost libraries using Homebrew. Run the following command: `brew install boost`. Homebrew will download and install the Boost libraries and their dependencies.

. To verify that the Boost libraries are installed correctly, you can run the following command: `brew list boost`. This command will show the installed files for the Boost libraries.

Now the Boost libraries are installed on your macOS system, and you can use them in your projects.

To use Boost in your projects, you may need to configure your build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile, Xcode) to include the appropriate header files and link against the Boost libraries. The specific configuration depends on the build system and the Boost libraries you're using.
