= Getting Started with macOS

To install Boost libraries on macOS, you can use Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software packages. Here's a step-by-step guide to installing the Boost libraries using Homebrew.

== Prerequisites

Homebrew has a few prerequisites, one of which is the Xcode Command Line Tools. The Xcode Command Line Tools include essential developer tools, like compilers and build utilities, that Homebrew needs to function properly.

When you install Homebrew using the installation script, it will automatically check for the presence of the Xcode Command Line Tools. If they are not already installed, the script will prompt you to install them.

However, if you want to manually install the Xcode Command Line Tools before installing Homebrew, you can follow these steps:

. Open Terminal.

. Run the following command: `xcode-select --install`. A pop-up window will appear, prompting you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click *Install* to start the installation process.

Once the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, you can proceed with installing Homebrew.

It's important to note that the full Xcode application is not required to use Homebrew, but it can be beneficial for developers who need additional development tools or want to create macOS and iOS applications. You can download and install the full Xcode application from the Mac App Store if you need it.

== Install Homebrew

You can skip step 1 if you have already installed Homebrew.

. Open Terminal and run the following command: 

+
[source]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
----
+
This command will download and execute the Homebrew installation script. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

. Update Homebrew. Before installing the Boost libraries, it's a good idea to update Homebrew to ensure you have the latest package information. Run the following command: `brew update`.

== Install Boost

. Now you can install the Boost libraries using Homebrew. Run the following command: `brew install boost`. Homebrew will download and install the Boost libraries and their dependencies.

. To verify that the Boost libraries are installed correctly, you can run the following command: `brew list boost`. This command will show the installed files for the Boost libraries.

Now the Boost libraries are installed on your macOS system, and you can use them in your projects.

To use Boost in your projects, you may need to configure your build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile, Xcode) to include the appropriate header files and link against the Boost libraries. The specific configuration depends on the build system and the Boost libraries you're using.
