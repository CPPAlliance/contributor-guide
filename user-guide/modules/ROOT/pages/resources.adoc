:navtitle: Resources

For additional resources when it comes to learning about and using Boost, there are some helpful external options. If you like hard-copy format, there is a range of published <<Books>>. If you prefer an online format, there are quite a few tutorials published on <<YouTube>>. These options are good at giving the overall picture, and getting you started. 

If you have very specific technical questions <<Stack Overflow>> may well have the answer.

== Books

There are a number of books published, either on Boost libraries as a set, or on one particular library:

== YouTube

Consider searching https://www.youtube.com/[YouTube] for online tutorials. There are tutorials on installing Boost, a beginners guide to Boost, introductions to individual libraries (such as boost:variant[] and boost:python[]), and on contributing libraries to Boost.

== Stack Overflow

For more specific technical questions, Stack Overflow has many questions and answers:
