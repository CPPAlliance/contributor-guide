= Glossary

You will find a myriad of jargon, acronyms and product or tool names used both in technical documentation and social media discussion of the Boost pass:[C++]Libraries and pass:[C++] development in general. This section contains descriptions of the most common.

You will find well known acronyms such as DLL, URL and UUID in this list, because they also refer to Boost libraries of the same name.
