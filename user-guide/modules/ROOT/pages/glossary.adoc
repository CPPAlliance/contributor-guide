*JIT* : Just-In-Time (Compilation) - while JIT compilation is more commonly associated with languages like JavaScript or Java, it is occasionally discussed in the context of pass:[C++] when talking about optimization techniques, runtime compilation, or performance-critical applications. Some pass:[C++] libraries (e.g., LLVM) support JIT compilation features.

== K

*KISS* : _Keep It Simple, Stupid_

== L

*LGTM* : _Looks Good To Me_

*LIFO* : Last In, First Out

*LOL* : _Laughing Out Loud_

*LSP* : Liskov Substitution Principle - states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program, ensuring that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without altering expected behavior.

== M

*MVP* : Model-View-Presenter

*MDS* :

* Meltdown Data Sampling : in the context of system security and CPU vulnerabilities, MDS refers to a family of side-channel attacks that target weaknesses in modern CPU architectures. These attacks can potentially leak sensitive data through speculative execution flaws, similar to vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre.

* Modular Design Structure : sometimes used to describe a software design methodology in which systems are broken down into modules, allowing for separation of concerns and better maintainability.

* Multiple Data Streams : a more abstract term, refers to scenarios where an application handles multiple data streams simultaneously, possibly in a parallel or distributed environment.

== N

*NDA* : Non-Disclosure Agreement

*NTTP* : Non-Type Template Parameter

== O

*OOB* : Out of Bounds (or Out of Band)

*OOP* : Object-Oriented Programming

== P

*PIMPL* : Pointer to IMPLementation (or the "Cheshire Cat" idiom)

*POD* : _Plain Old Data_

*POSIX* : Portable Operating System Interface

*PR* : Pull Request

== Q

*QML* : Qt Meta Language - a declarative language used in conjunction with Qt for designing user interfaces. QML is commonly referenced in pass:[C++] discussions related to UI development in Qt.

*QOI* : Quite OK Image format - a relatively new image file format that aims to provide lossless image compression with a focus on simplicity and speed, sometimes used in performance-critical applications dealing with image processing.
